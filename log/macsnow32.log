So the address for the first process's name is: 0x85df24
So the address for the second process's name is: 0x5c0ac2
So the address for the second process's name is: 0x831cae
So the address for the second process's name is: 0xc099dc
So the address for the second process's name is: 0x2d5705e
So the address for the second process's name is: 0x2d9a014
So the address for the second process's name is: 0x2ddcc94
So the address for the second process's name is: 0x2dee2de
So the address for the second process's name is: 0x2defec4
min is 0x2defac4
value_of_next0 is 0x2defd20
max is 0x2df02c4
min is 0x2defac4
value_of_next0 is 0x2defd20
max is 0x2df02c4
offset_of_name_in_task is 0x1a4
offset_of_next_in_task is 0x4
value_of_next1 is 0x2def7e0
the buffer we read in is kextd
and proc_name2 is kextd
Now we found the offset of the next pointer of the first process is 0x85dd84
And the address for the first process name is: 0x85df24
And the address for the second process name is: 0x2defec4
offset_of_name_in_task is 0x1a4
offset_of_next_in_task is 0x4
